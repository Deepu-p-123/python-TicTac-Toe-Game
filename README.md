Tic Tac Toe game using python 

Tic-tac-toe is a simple, two-player game that is played on a 3x3 grid. 
The players take turns placing their symbol, either an “X” or an “O”, on an empty space on the grid.
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.
If all of the spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

Tic-tac-toe is a popular game because it is easy to learn and quick to play. It is often used as a teaching tool for young children to develop their strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. Despite its simplicity, tic-tac-toe can be surprisingly challenging, and there are many strategies that players can use to increase their chances of winning.
